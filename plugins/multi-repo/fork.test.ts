/**
 * Forks, and the binding that keeps them attached to the checkout they

 *
 * A fork reuses its source thread's environment, so `create()` never runs for
 * it and no second workspace is provisioned. Everything here is about the
 * consequence: a thread that resolved a workspace by its own id saw nothing at
 * all — no diffs, no repo list, no layout block, and a tool error blaming a
 * provider that was not involved.
