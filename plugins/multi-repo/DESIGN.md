# Multi-repo workspaces — design

A standalone BB plugin that gives a project **a set of git repos** and every thread **one workspace containing a checkout of each**.

## Scope

**In scope.** Provisioning multi-repo thread workspaces, configuring the repo set, a per-machine object cache, agent-facing tools and instructions, and a plugin-owned diff/PR panel.

**Explicitly out of scope — this plugin is standalone:**

- **No fork of bb.** Nothing here requires a core change. One possible core improvement is noted in [Out of scope](#out-of-scope) purely so the option is recorded; the design does not depend on it and must not be built assuming it.
- **No bb-internal packages.** `bb-environment-provider-host` (which exposes `runGit`, `detectGitRepo`, `readDefaultBranchRefs`, and the git ref mutation lock) is `"private": true` and reachable only from plugins bundled inside the bb repo. This plugin ships its own git argument layer.

  It does **not** need its own process layer. `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/host` publishes `experimental_spawnPortableOutputProcess` — documented as being "for host-local plugin operations such as git" — plus `experimental_sanitizeInheritedChildProcessEnv` (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/host.ts:46-56`). Build argument construction, exit-code handling and output parsing on top of those; do not reimplement spawning.
- **No dependency on other plugins in this repo.** No shared code with `kubernetes-provider`, `thread-briefs`, or `workstreams`. It must work on a stock bb install with only the bundled plugins present.

Core references below were verified against bb at commit `611e34892` (2026-09-24) and re-verified line by line on 2026-09-29. They are the evidence that this design works without core changes; re-check them when upgrading bb.

---

## 1. Concepts

A **project's source is a `.bb` git repo** — the workspace definition, not the code. It contains:

```
repos.json      the repo set
AGENTS.md       cross-repo guidance (read natively by bb)
skills/         project skills (read natively by bb)
```

A **thread workspace** is a plain directory holding one clone per repo, plus `.bb` itself. Every repo is equal; there is no privileged primary repo.

```
<plugin host-data>/
  repos/<key>.git            bare, self-contained object cache (per machine)
  workspaces/<pathKey>/      ← environment.path (plain dir, isGitRepo: false)
    bb-dylan/                clone, origin = real remote
    bb-plugins/              clone, origin = real remote
    .bb/                     clone of the project-source checkout
```

`<pathKey>` is the provider's per-thread path key. A repo's directory name is whatever `repos.json` says, defaulting to the repo's own name — so two repos sharing a basename can still be disambiguated explicitly.

## 2. Configuration

### `repos.json`

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "repos": [
    { "url": "git@github.com:you/bb-dylan.git" },
    { "url": "git@github.com:you/bb-plugins.git", "branch": "main" },
    { "dir": "bb-plugins-fork", "url": "git@github.com:me/bb-plugins.git" }
  ]
}
```

- `dir` — directory name inside the workspace, and a safe single path segment. Optional: the parser infers it from the URL's last component minus `.git`, and fails the entry by name when nothing usable comes out rather than inventing `repo-1`. Resolution happens once, at parse; everything downstream sees a `dir`. An inferred `dir` is flagged as such so serialization omits it again, keeping an unrelated add or remove a one-line diff.
- `url` — anything git can clone, including a local path. A local path makes "base this on my local checkout" a first-class option.
- `branch` — optional base branch. Defaults to that repo's default branch.

**Branches float; never pin SHAs.** This is a dev workspace, not a release manifest. Pinning buys reproducibility nobody asked for and creates staleness someone has to manage.

Keep it strict JSON. Documentation lives in the seeded `AGENTS.md` and the plugin UI, not in comments.

`repos.json` is the single source of truth. The plugin UI *edits and commits* it; it never shadows it with a separate store. Plugin storage holds derived state only: cache freshness, workspace manifests, precomputed layout text.

### Where `.bb` lives

`project_sources.path` is the canonical `.bb` checkout, per `(projectId, hostId)` — one per machine (`packages/db/src/schema.ts:496`).

Two ways in, same code path afterwards:

- **Shared** — the `.bb` repo has a remote. Clone it, create the project pointing at it. A teammate gets the whole workspace definition from one URL.
- **Local, from scratch** — create the project pointing at a fresh directory. The plugin initializes `.bb` on first use. No remote, no setup.

The local variant upgrades to shared with `git remote add` and a push. Nothing else in the design changes and there is no migration.

## 3. Why a plain-directory workspace root

The root is not a git repo. Verified consequences:

- **It's a supported shape.** `environment-personal-workspace` already ships a non-git workspace.
- **Nothing errors.** `getAdditionalWorkspaceWriteRoots()` returns `[]` when the root isn't a git worktree (`packages/host-workspace/src/provision.ts:136-139`).
- **Everything is writable.** All repos sit under `cwd`, so they're writable under `accept-edits`/`auto` — no `full` permission mode needed. Permission scopes are only `workspace` and `full` (`packages/domain/src/shared-types.ts:495`), and `workspace` grants `cwd` plus additional roots (`packages/provider-bridge-acp/src/session-params.ts:313`).
- **`.bb` lands exactly where bb looks.** `<workspacePath>/.bb/AGENTS.md` (`apps/server/src/services/threads/workspace-agent-instructions.ts:13`) and `<workspacePath>/.bb/skills` (`apps/server/src/services/skills/workspace-skills.ts:83`) are plain path joins with no git requirement.

**Hazard: never create `<root>/.git`.** `packages/host-watcher/src/workspace-status-watcher.ts:324-332` promotes the environment to git mode the moment it appears, which would switch on a misleading native diff tab mid-session. The check is root-relative (`:157-160`), so nested repo `.git` directories are safe.

## 4. Why clones, not worktrees

`git worktree add` leaves the object store in the source repo, outside `cwd`. The agent could edit files but every `git commit` would fail on a sandboxed write to `objects`/`refs`.

A clone puts `.git` **inside** `cwd`. Use `--shared` (or `--reference`) so objects resolve from the per-machine cache: the alternates pointer is only ever read, and reads are unrestricted.

Two independent confirmations that a `.git` under `cwd` is writable:

1. `environment-project-checkout` ships a plain non-worktree repo as the workspace, receives `[]` additional write roots, and commits fine.
2. `packages/host-workspace/src/workspace-write-roots.ts:57-60` filters out candidate roots *nested under* the workspace — only coherent if nested git dirs are already writable.

Secondary benefit: two threads cannot both check out `main` as worktrees of one repo, but independent clones can. `.bb` tracks its default branch in every workspace, so this matters.

## 5. Pull-through object cache

Per repo, in order:

1. **Cache hit** — the internal bare clone exists. Fetch if stale.
2. **Local mirror** — a checkout on this machine has a matching `origin`: `git clone --bare <that-path>` hardlinks objects (instant, no network), then `git remote set-url origin <real-url>` and fetch the delta.
3. **Network** — `git clone --bare <real-url>`.

Discovery for step 2 uses bb's own registry of local checkouts: `bb.sdk.projects.list()` returns every project with its `sources[]` — `projectResponseSchema` is `projectSchema.extend({ sources })` (`packages/server-contract/src/api/projects.ts:432-435`) and each source is a `local_path` carrying `{ hostId, path }` (`packages/domain/src/project.ts:31-40`). One call enumerates every checkout bb knows about on this machine, and the plugin reads each one's `origin`. Add the project-source directory's siblings and one configurable extra search root.

Two rules:

- **The cache must be self-contained.** Never seed it with `--shared`/`--reference` from a user's checkout — deleting or gc'ing that checkout would corrupt every workspace chained off it. A plain bare clone still hardlinks, so it stays cheap and stands alone. Alternates belong only on the workspace→cache hop, where the plugin owns both ends.
- **Always fetch from the real remote after mirroring.** A local checkout carries stale refs and local-only branches.

Cache repos are alternates targets, so set `gc.auto=0` and `gc.pruneExpire=never` on them; repack with `git gc --no-prune`.

**The lock is the plugin's to build.** Nothing in the published SDK is a mutex: `experimental_retainWorker()` returns an `ExperimentalHostWorkerLease`, which only keeps a host worker alive past the current call (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/host-contract.ts:102-134`), and the ref-mutation lock in `bb-environment-provider-host/locks` is private. Budget a real cross-process file lock — concurrent thread creation against one cache entry is the expected case, not a rare one.

Freshness: fetch-if-stale with a short TTL at `create()`, plus a background refresh on a `bb.background` cron. Never fetch synchronously on every thread start.

## 6. Provider lifecycle

Declares `requires: { projectCheckout: true }`, which guarantees a non-null `context.projectCheckout.path` with **no** git availability gating — that only fires for `requires.gitCheckout` (`apps/server/src/services/threads/thread-environment-placement.ts:320,327`).

### `create()`

1. **Bootstrap `.bb`** if `projectCheckout.path` has no `.git`: `git init`, seed `AGENTS.md` and `repos.json`, commit.
2. **Refresh** the project-source checkout (fetch-if-stale), then parse and validate `repos.json`.
3. **Seed by discovery** if the repo set is empty — propose repos found on this machine rather than producing an empty workspace.
4. **Populate the cache** per repo (§5), under a file lock. Concurrent thread creation against one cache entry is normal, not an edge case.
5. **Materialize the workspace**: claim the root with `context.experimental_claimPath(root)` before writing to it, create it, clone each repo plus `.bb`, rewrite each work repo's `origin` to its real remote, and create the shared thread branch in each work repo. `.bb` stays on its default branch.
6. **Precompute the layout** table and write it to plugin storage keyed by environment (see §8).
7. Return `{ status: "created", path: <root>, ownsPath: true, resource: { workspaces: [...] } }`.

The result type also allows an optional `mergeBaseBranch`. Leave it unset: it is a single value on a flattened environment row and this workspace has one merge base per repo, so §9 computes merge bases itself. Setting it would publish one repo's base branch as if it spoke for all of them.

Report progress with `report.step` / `report.log` throughout. A cold start is a full network clone per repo and will read as hung otherwise.

### `remove()`

Kill first, then delete. `experimental_killProcessesWithCwdUnder` (`@get-bb/plugin-sdk/host`) is published for exactly this — "for a provider tearing down a workspace it made" (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/host.ts:38-44`) — and it SIGTERMs then SIGKILLs anything whose cwd sits under the root. Without it, removal races a language server or watcher still holding a repo.

Then enumerate every directory under the workspace root and remove each. Write a `<dir>.completed` marker per repo during `create()` so a partially provisioned workspace is recoverable per repo rather than all-or-nothing.

### Branching

Take the branch name from `context.suggestedBranchName` (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/environment-provider.ts:61`) rather than generating one — it is already bb's name for this thread, so plugin branches read like native ones. Use that single name in **every** work repo, so PRs across repos correlate by head ref. Fall back per repo on collision; the symmetry is a convenience, not an invariant.

### Policy

Take both defaults, deliberately (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/environment-provider.ts:98-104`):

- `pathKeys: "per-thread"` — a rebuild deliberately uses a fresh key "to avoid dead paths," so a rebuild re-clones every repo. That is the correct trade against serving a half-torn-down workspace, and the object cache keeps the cost local rather than networked.
- `retireGraceMs` — the five-minute default is right. Keeping these workspaces indefinitely would accumulate a full checkout set per thread on the machine's disk.

`ownsPath: true` is what makes both of these bb's problem rather than the plugin's.

### Failure policy

A repo that fails to materialize should not fail the whole environment. Record per-repo status and surface it in the panel; the thread is still useful with three of four repos present.

## 7. Sandbox boundaries

| Path | Agent can write |
|---|---|
| Anything under the workspace root, including every repo's `.git` | yes |
| `host-data/` cache, canonical `.bb` checkout | no |

Work repos push to their real remotes over the network — unaffected.

**`.bb` write-back inverts direction** and runs host-side in a plugin tool:

```bash
git -C <canonical-.bb> fetch <workspace>/.bb HEAD:refs/heads/guidance-<threadId>
```

Every write happens in the canonical repo, initiated by the plugin's host entry, which runs outside the agent's sandbox. This avoids the sandbox *and* `receive.denyCurrentBranch`, since the target ref isn't the checked-out branch. Merge it in the canonical checkout like any branch.

## 8. Agent-facing surface

### Generated facts

`bb.agents.contributeInstructions` supplies a dynamic instruction block. Two constraints to design around (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/backend-contract.ts:1656-1671`): the provider is **synchronous** and sits on the thread-start path, and output is truncated at 4096 characters. It therefore cannot shell out to git.

Precompute the layout at `create()` — a compact table of `dir → path → branch → remote` — store it, and have the callback read and format it. No git in the callback, and no truncation risk for a repo set of any sane size.

**It is not live, and one path makes that visible.** The contract is explicit: "A live provider session keeps the instructions it was constructed with — a changed contribution takes effect when the provider session is next constructed... never mid-session" (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/backend-contract.ts:1658-1663`). So a repo added by `workspace_add_repo` mid-thread will **not** appear in this block, even though its files are on disk.

The tool result is the only channel that reaches a live session, so `workspace_add_repo` must return the new repo's `dir`, absolute path and branch in its result text rather than telling the agent to consult the layout. The block is authoritative at thread start and stale only with respect to that one tool — which is precisely the tool that can repair it.

### Human intent

The seeded `.bb/AGENTS.md`, read natively by bb. This is where cross-repo reasoning lives: which repo depends on which, what has to be rebuilt or redeployed when a given repo changes, what belongs in which repo.

**Keep the split clean: the plugin generates facts, the file holds intent.** Paths written into `AGENTS.md` drift. Intent written into the generated block can't be edited.

The seed must also explain `.bb/` itself — that it is shared across every thread in the project, versioned, and the right place to record durable cross-repo knowledge. Otherwise agents won't use it.

### Tools

Registered with `bb.agents.registerTool`:

- `workspace_add_repo({ url, dir?, branch? })` — append to `repos.json` in the canonical `.bb` and commit; populate the cache; clone into the **live** workspace so the repo appears without restarting the thread. All three writes run host-side, so this works under `accept-edits`.
- `workspace_list_repos` — the current set with per-repo branch and status.
- `workspace_remove_repo({ dir })` — remove from `repos.json`; leave existing workspaces alone.

Plus a manifest skill (`bb.skills`) documenting when to reach for them, and a `bb repos` CLI command via `bb.cli.register` — worth having because the repo list lives in a plugin destination rather than bb's Project settings page.

## 9. Diff and PR

The workspace root isn't a git repo, so bb's native diff tab and PR state are unavailable (see [Known limits](#known-limits)). The plugin owns both surfaces.

### Reused, not rebuilt

`experimental_Diff` (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/app.ts:144`, props at `packages/plugin-sdk/src/app-contract.ts:561-584`) is a host-owned diff viewer available to plugins. It owns patch normalization, syntax highlighting, unified/split presentation, gutters, line-selection, optional full-file context expansion, and the live bb code theme. Pass `{ patch, path }` — a unified patch for one file.

This is the expensive part of a diff UI and it comes free.

### To build

| Component | Rough size |
|---|---|
| Git argument layer + repo/branch detectors (spawning comes from the SDK) | 100–150 |
| Diff data layer — merge base, name-status/numstat, per-file patch, untracked files | 400–500 |
| PR layer — `gh` field parsing and normalizers, actions, polling and caching | ~400 |
| Panel UI — repo grouping, file list, selection, per-repo header | 500–700 |

Reference material in bb (read, don't import): the `gh --json` field list and the checks/review/mergeability normalizers at `packages/host-workspace/src/git-host.ts:35-38,235-282`; the bundled `github` plugin's batched polling into a plugin SQLite table at `plugins/github/server.ts:670-695`.

Defer bb's hardening until it's needed: diff tiering and pagination, list virtualization, byte budgeting, patch-section splitting. Cap file count and per-file bytes instead.

Surfaces: `ui.threadPanelAction` for the panel, `ui.fileOpener` to claim workspace file-open targets so timeline file links route in rather than dead-ending.

**Estimate: ~1,650–2,150 LOC, for §9 only.** It excludes provisioning, the cache, and the file lock from §5 — milestones 4 and 5 are where an estimate like this usually breaks, so treat it as a floor.

## 10. Packaging

One plugin, one package — `plugins/multi-repo/`:

```json
{
  "name": "bb-plugin-multi-repo",
  "type": "module",
  "engines": { "bb": ">=0.0", "bbPluginSdk": ">=0.5.24" },
  "bb": {
    "name": "Multi-repo workspace",
    "description": "Give a project a set of git repos and every thread a checkout of each.",
    "branding": { "icon": "FolderGit" },
    "server": "./server.ts",
    "host": "./host.ts",
    "app": "./app.tsx",
    "skills": ["skills"]
  },
  "dependencies": { "zod": "^4.3.6" },
  "devDependencies": { "@get-bb/plugin-sdk": "0.5.24" }
}
```

Three entry points in one package, because `bb.storage` and RPC routes are namespaced per plugin and the panel needs the provider's layout records. Splitting provisioning from UI would mean cross-plugin state access.

The `bb` floor is `">=0.0"`, matching every bundled plugin; the only one that declares more is `browser-automation` at `">=0.41"`, and there is no 0.43 in the tree to pin to. The SDK floor is the real constraint — `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` is at `0.5.24` — and it carries everything required: `./environment-provider`, `./host`, `./app`, `./testing`. UI primitives (React, Radix, clsx, and similar) are ordinary dev dependencies bundled at build time.

**Install:** `bb plugin install <path-or-git-source>`. No other plugin needs to be present and no bb fork is involved.

*Environment-specific note, not a dependency:* a deployment that bakes plugins into a server image can add this directory to the image's plugin checkout list and its plugin-dirs environment variable; nothing in the plugin assumes that packaging.

## 11. Build order

1. **Provider cold start** — bootstrap `.bb`, discovery seed, cache population, workspace materialization, progress reporting, layout precompute, `contributeInstructions`. Proves the sandbox and commit story end to end, with no UI.
2. **Tools and skill** — including live `workspace_add_repo`.
3. **Nav panel** — repo list, per-repo and cache status, `repos.json` editing with loud validation. Plus `bb repos`.
4. **Diff panel.**
5. **PR panel.**

Milestone 1 is the load-bearing one. Everything after it is additive and independently shippable.

## Known limits

Accepted consequences, not bugs:

- **No native diff tab, PR badge, sidebar PR attention, or AI commit message.** PR state isn't persisted anywhere — there is no pull-request table in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`; `threadPullRequest` is computed live from `environment.path`. There is no row for a plugin to populate. Diff and PR live in the plugin panel.
- **Not in bb's Project settings page.** No project-settings slot exists among the plugin app slots, so the repo list lives in a plugin nav panel beside bb's project settings. Someone looking in the obvious place won't find it — hence the CLI command.
- **A local-only `.bb` is single-machine**, enforced by core: setting a project up on a new machine requires a git remote (`apps/server/src/services/projects/project-source-setup.ts:188-192`). Give `.bb` a remote when it needs to travel.
- **Cold start is a full network clone per repo**, once per machine. Mitigated by the cache and local mirroring, not eliminated.
- **`bb project show` displays the `.bb` remote** as the project's git remote, since core probes it from the project source. Defensible — the project *is* the workspace definition — but it reads oddly at first.
- **`repos.json` sits on the critical path** for every thread creation in the project. Validate with a schema and fail naming the offending entry.
- **The repo set is fixed at `create()`.** Existing workspaces don't gain repos added later except via `workspace_add_repo`. Deliberate: a workspace shouldn't mutate under a running thread.

## Out of scope

Recorded for completeness only. **The design does not depend on either and neither should be built as part of it.**

- **True worktrees instead of clones.** Would need core to grant write access to nested repos' git directories — dropping the `isWorktree` guard at `packages/host-workspace/src/provision.ts:137` and having `workspace-write-roots.ts` scan subdirectories for worktrees. Small and a strict generalization, but it is a core change. Clones with a shared object cache are cheap enough that this is a disk optimization, not a capability.
- **Native multi-repo git and PR state in bb.** Would need per-workspace rows on the environment (replacing the flattened `path`/`branchName`/`baseBranch`/`mergeBaseBranch` columns) and `threadPullRequest` becoming a list. This plugin's per-repo model is deliberately shaped so it could migrate onto that if it ever lands.
