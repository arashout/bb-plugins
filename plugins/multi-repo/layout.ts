/**
 * The workspace manifest, and the instruction block the agent reads.
 *
 * **Why this is precomputed.** `bb.agents.contributeInstructions` is
 * synchronous and runs on the thread-start path, so the callback cannot shell
 * out to git — asking four repos for their branch at thread start would put a
 * process spawn between the user pressing send and the model seeing anything.
 * `create()` already knows every fact the block needs, so it writes the
 * manifest to plugin storage and the callback formats what it finds. No git in
 * the callback and no work proportional to the repo count at thread start.
 *
 * **Why it is a table of facts and nothing else.** The generated block says
 * where things are; `.bb/AGENTS.md` says what they mean. Paths written into
 * `AGENTS.md` drift the first time a repo is renamed, and intent written into
 * this block cannot be edited by the person who holds it. Keeping the split
 * clean is what makes both halves trustworthy.
 *
 * Pure: the formatting is a function of the manifest, so the 4096-character
 * ceiling is testable without a server.
