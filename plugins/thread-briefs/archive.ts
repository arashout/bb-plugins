 * believes they left on screen.
 *
 * - **No brief, or not done.** The only threads eligible are ones this plugin
 *   has read and concluded are finished. A manual `done` pin counts: it is the
 *   user saying so, which is a better signal than the derivation, not a worse
 *   one.
 * - **Pinned.** A pin is a deliberate "keep this in front of me" and outranks
 *   anything inferred. It still goes grey — the ring stays honest about the
 *   thread being cold — it just never leaves.
 * - **Busy, hidden, deleted, already archived.** Nothing to do, or not ours.
 * - **Auto-archived before.** See `autoArchivedAt` on the stored brief: this is
 *   a thread we archived and the user pulled back, and that decision is final
 *   until they work in it again.
