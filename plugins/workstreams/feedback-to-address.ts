// Feedback to address: what a reviewer said on your PR that still waits on
// your answer. An approval that says anything (a comment, a question, a
// condition, or a request) and any other person's comment (a review body, an
// inline thread, or the PR's conversation) wait until you answer: a reply
// from the PR's author on this PR after it (a conversation comment, a review,
// or a thread reply) or, for an approval's notes, your evidence-checked
// Confirm on this head. An issue or a PR that mentions this one, such as the
// rest of its stack, answers nothing: the reviewer sees no reply, so Confirm
// shows those links as evidence instead. A push alone answers nothing, and
// none of it depends on CI, a draft, conflicts, or merge state. While any
// waits, the PR never reads ready and never merges. Bots (deploy previews,
// trackers, CI, and code-review apps) never count. This module imports only
// zod, so the browser can use it (A12.1).
