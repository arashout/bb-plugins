// Keeping your place in the effort deck (plan amendment A15 and
// design-directions/inventory-calm/PLACE-LOSS.md). Pure: the deck's nav view
// feeds it the DOM measurements and storage it reads.
//
// - Rows hold still. Each view keeps a snapshot of its rows as you last
//   marked them seen; a row a read changed stays in its old section with a
//   dot, a row that left stays as a ghost, and a new row joins the end of
//   its section and stays there, a ghost too if it leaves again. Only Mark
//   seen, for that view alone, settles them.
// - The card order is set once per session: new, resumed, and reopened
//   efforts join the end of the efforts, before the service cards, so an
//   effort's number key never shifts.
// - Scroll anchors hold a row at its pixel through reads, resizes, and flips,
//   with a spacer above the view when that would need a negative scroll.
// - Focus falls back through one chain and never lands on the page body.
