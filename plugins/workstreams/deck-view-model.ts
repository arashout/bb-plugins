// The effort deck's view model (plan amendment A15, effort card v2): pure
// functions from deck_get's output, what each view last marked seen, and the
// view's own state to what the deck draws. The server placed each row in its
// section; this ranks a card's rows into its few moves (rankMoves), words its
// finish line, counts Your turn for its strip chip, and says which actions the
// keys, hint bar, ? sheet, and ⌘K offer right now. Moves and keys follow the
// read as All PRs does; Mark seen only settles what changed since you looked
// (deck-place.ts). It imports types, zero-import modules, All PRs' time
// format, and approval-evidence.ts's wording (zod only), so no server module
// reaches the browser (A12.1).
