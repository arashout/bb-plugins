// Batch actions from the effort deck (plan amendment A15). A section button, a
// selection, or Advance first plans: each PR's one write, bound to the facts
// its row showed, and why any PR is left out. You confirm that plan; it sends
// 8 seconds later unless you Undo. Dispatch runs exactly the planned items,
// each through the inventory action's own guards (a fresh read, a hold,
// another writer, and facts changed since the row), so a refusal refuses that
// PR only. Advance plans every safe batch in an effort: nudges,
// review requests, and mark ready, never a merge, a thread's work, or a
// confirmation of review notes, which is yours to make one PR at a time after
// reading them. A PR whose effort you hold or complete after confirming, or
// that leaves its effort, is refused instead of sent. Release (A17.3) lifts
// your holds the same way: listed, then after the window, and never by Advance.
// It writes nothing to GitHub, so it runs on any pile, as holding a PR does.
// Ask sends one PR's own thread the approval-feedback recipe, from that PR's
// review notes when nothing since the approval shows them handled; never Advance.
// Fix sends each PR in Work in threads its own fix (conflicts, CI, requested
// changes) in its existing thread, or starts a worker for it only when it has
// none, and only where its listing said; never Advance, and never a merge.
// Address takes the Your turn PRs you selected: by default one new batch
// thread for all of them, which claims each PR before it starts, so its items
// send together; or each PR's own thread, through Ask and Fix, only for a PR
// that has one. Never Advance, and never a merge.
//
// A batch lives in one row. Undo and dispatch each claim it from `scheduled`
// in one statement, so exactly one wins, even while a reload's replacement
// load overlaps the old one. An item is marked `sending` before
// its write and settled after, so a restart re-arms a waiting batch, keeps a
// cancel, and never sends an item twice: one cut off mid-send is `unknown`.
// A batch the plugin was closed through for over a minute past its window
// sends nothing more: you confirmed it for then, not for whenever it runs again.
