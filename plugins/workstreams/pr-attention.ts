// The PR inventory's three questions for each open PR: is it forgotten in
// draft, is it missing a reviewer, and does it need a nudge. Pure: PR facts,
// holds, effort ownership, the clock, and thresholds in; each reason's next
// step, owner, and age out. Feedback to address comes first, whatever CI,
// a draft, conflicts, or the merge state say, and holds the merge while it
// waits. Ages come from GitHub's timestamps where GitHub keeps one. Red
// checks and conflicts have none, so their age starts at the read that first
// saw the state: a lower bound, and labeled as one.
