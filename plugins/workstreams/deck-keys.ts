// The one key registry the effort deck and All PRs share (plan amendment
// A15): every action with its key, which the key handler, the hint bar, the
// ? sheet, and the ⌘K palette all read, so a key means the same thing
// everywhere. This module imports nothing, so the browser bundle can use it
// without reaching a server module (A12.1).
//
// Safety lives in each action's effect. Only "confirm" and "preview" actions
// can lead to a GitHub write, and neither writes on its key: a confirm opens
// the listing of every PR it would touch, which then waits out its Undo
// window, and a preview opens the fresh merge preview, where only a click or
// ⌘↵ merges. Enter and Space are never bound to either.
