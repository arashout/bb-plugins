// Your turn lists your PRs where a person's feedback waits on you, and nothing else, as the Reviews plugin reads it: each of the four
// clauses puts a PR on, a bot never does, and your answer takes it off. A PR waiting only on CI or on its reviewers stays off, so the badge
// never asks you to act where nothing is yours. One rule then says where a PR lists and whether Address takes it: a hold or a thread at
// work keeps it off, Dismiss hides it until its head moves or a person says more, and a sent PR keeps its thread's link with BB's live
// status for as long as it's open.
