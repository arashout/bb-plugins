// Putting a new devbox on the tailnet.
//
// A devbox must join as its developer's own node, not a tagged one: bb-gate
// routes a daemon to its owner's server by the tailnet identity it dials
// from, and tsjwt refuses tagged callers. So there is no auth key to mint;
// the developer signs in, once per machine, at the URL tailscaled prints.
// This module starts that login and reads tailscaled's state; the provider
// surfaces the URL and waits.
