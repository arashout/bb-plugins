# Devbox machines

Create [devbox](https://github.com/bitcomplete/devbox) machines from bb.
Connect your devbox project once, then create machines from the plugin's
settings section (Settings → Plugins → Devbox machines) or with
`bb machine create --provider devbox`. bb's own Settings → Machines → Add
machine offers only manual setup, so it does not list Devbox; machines
created here appear there like any other once they exist.

## How it works

```
bb (this plugin) ──Bearer──▶ devbox-gate :8081 (in-cluster) ──your restricted cert──▶ Incus on bertha
```

- **Connect.** Settings → Plugins → Devbox machines → *Connect devbox*
  sends your browser to devbox, which asks you to approve bb. devbox
  redirects back to this plugin's callback with a one-time code, and the
  plugin exchanges it (PKCE) for a token, kept in the `token` secret
  setting. devbox only ever redirects to callback URIs registered in its
  client registry, so this server's must be listed there; see devbox's
  `docs/connect.md`. Disconnect revokes the token.
- **Create.** The plugin creates a container from the `devbox` image with
  the `default` and `devbox` profiles in your project, waits for
  cloud-init, enables lingering for `dev` (bb's daemon is a user service),
  and starts `tailscale up --ssh`.
- **Sign in to Tailscale.** A devbox has to join as *your* node: bb-gate
  routes a daemon to its owner's server by tailnet identity and refuses
  tagged nodes, so there is no key to mint. The sign-in link appears in the
  machine's creation log and in this plugin's settings section. Creation
  waits for it (20 minutes by default).
- **Enroll.** Core installs and enrolls the bb daemon as `dev` over Incus
  exec, through devbox-gate.

| Operation | What happens |
|---|---|
| create | Create (or, on retry, reuse) the container tagged `user.bb.key=<creation key>`, checkpoint, prepare, sign in, bootstrap. |
| suspend | Stop the container. |
| resume | Start it, wait for Tailscale to reconnect (asking for sign-in again only if the login expired), bootstrap with the original key. |
| remove | `tailscale logout`, stop, delete. The disk goes with it. |
| reconcileCleanup | Delete containers whose `user.bb.key` is the creation key. |

Machines persist (`ephemeral: false`); nothing suspends them on its own.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `devboxUrl` | `https://devbox.boreray-eel.ts.net` | Where the browser approves. |
| `apiUrl` | `http://devbox-gate.devbox-production.svc.cluster.local:8081` | devbox-gate's API listener, as the server reaches it. |
| `clientId` | `bb` | This server's ID in devbox's client registry. |
| `token` | — | Secret. Set by Connect devbox. |
| `image` | `devbox` | Image alias for new machines. |
| `profiles` | `default,devbox` | Profiles for new machines. |
| `signInTimeoutMinutes` | `20` | How long creation waits for Tailscale sign-in. |

Machine inputs: `name?` (Incus name; default `bb-<6 hex>` from the
creation key, so a retry finds the same container) and `image?`.

The server must have a public address (`BB_APP_URL`) for the callback, and
its namespace must be admitted to devbox-gate's port 8081 (devbox's
`bc-prod.yaml`).
