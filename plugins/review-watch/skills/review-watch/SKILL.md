name: review-watch
description: Read the GitHub review queue and start work on a queued item. Use when the user asks what needs their review, what pull requests are waiting, which reviews are outstanding, or asks to start or dismiss a queued review.

# Review watch

Review Watch keeps one queue of pull requests that need the user's attention. A
background poller asks GitHub every few minutes. The **Reviews** page and
`bb review-watch` command read the same queue. The sidebar and thread-header
badges show `review-requested` and `review-followup` items in two
colored chips. Each badge shows both counts, including zeros. Hover over the
header badge to see labeled counts, preview up to five review requests, and
open **Reviews**.

The queue is notify-only. Review Watch never posts to GitHub or starts a
thread on its own. A human chooses **Start**, **Review selected**, or
`bb review-watch start`.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `bb review-watch list` | Show the queue, grouped by rule, with each item's key. |
| `bb review-watch list --rule <rule>` | Show one group. |
| `bb review-watch start <key>` | Spawn a thread for one item and print the thread id. |
| `bb review-watch dismiss <key>` | Drop one item from the queue. |
| `bb review-watch poll` | Run one poll now and print what changed. |
| `bb review-watch status` | Show configuration, the last poll, and queue counts. |

Add `--json` to any command when the output drives code.

A key looks like `<rule>:<node-id>:<head-sha>`. Every command that takes a key
accepts any unambiguous prefix, so paste the first few characters rather than
the whole string.

## Rules

Each item carries one rule, which says why a human must act:

- `review-requested` — someone requests the user's review, and the user has not
  submitted a review on the pull request.
- `review-followup` — the user submitted an earlier review, and a newer head or
  explicit re-request needs the user's attention.

The user's own pull requests never enter the queue. For feedback on them, use
Workstreams, which shows it as **Your turn**.

## Authentication

The poller reads GitHub one of two ways, and `bb review-watch status` prints
which one is active:

- `transport: token` — the `githubToken` setting holds a personal access token.
  The token travels with the plugin's configuration, so this route suits a BB
  server on a remote host.
- `transport: gh` — `githubToken` is empty, so the poller shells out to `gh` and
  reuses the login it already holds. This route needs `gh` installed and
  authenticated on the host the BB server runs on, not on the user's laptop.

A thread started from a review item reads the pull request's diff and review
comments through `gh` under either route, so `gh` auth on the BB server host
matters even when the poller uses a token.

## Procedure

1. Run `bb review-watch list` before you act. Use the keys it prints; never
   guess a key.
2. To work an item, run `bb review-watch start <key>`. The new thread uses the
   configured project's default environment and carries a prompt for the
   item's rule. Find the matching repository checkout before inspecting code.
3. Report the thread id the command prints so the user can follow it.
4. Dismiss an item only when the user asks. Dismissing hides it for good; there
   is no undismiss in the CLI.
5. If `list` looks stale, run `bb review-watch poll` instead of waiting for the
   next tick.

In **Reviews**, select queued review requests and follow-ups, then choose
**Review selected** to open one aggregate review thread. This action does not
have a CLI command. Use **Start** to open an individual review thread.

Queued and started review items stay in their action sections and remain
counted. A started row links to its open thread and stays pending until a
GitHub poll confirms a submitted review newer than the item's baseline. A new
head supersedes the item; a closed or merged pull request ends its pending
status. The plugin moves completed or superseded reviewer items to **Archived
threads** at the bottom, where you can reopen their threads. Dismissed items do
not appear. Workstreams displays feedback on the user's own pull requests.

## Constraints

- Never post to GitHub on the user's behalf. In a thread started from a review
  item, present findings for the user to post: do not submit a review, approve,
  request changes, comment, or resolve a review thread.
- Never push code from a review thread. Present findings and next actions in
  the thread for the user.
- Change the queue only through `bb review-watch`. Do not edit bb.db or the
  plugin's storage directly.
- An empty queue with a failed `last poll` in `bb review-watch status` does not
  prove that no reviews need attention. Read the poll error. For transport
  failures, the error names the fix: set `githubToken` or authenticate `gh` on
  the BB server host. Tell the user what to run; do not set the token or run
  `gh auth` yourself.
- GitHub searches paginate through all matching pull requests. If nested
  review data is truncated, the poll fails and leaves the queue unchanged.
  Surface the poll error instead of treating partial data as a complete queue.

## Settings

Configure with `bb plugin config review-watch`:

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `githubToken` | A personal access token with `repo` scope. Optional: when it is empty, the poller reads GitHub through the `gh` CLI instead. |
| `project` | The BB project whose default environment runs started reviews. Required. |
| `pollMinutes` | Poll interval in minutes. Defaults to 5. |
| `repoAllowlist` | Comma-separated `owner/name` entries. Empty watches every repository. |
| `maxAgeDays` | Drop an item this old even if GitHub still lists it. Defaults to 14. |
| `provider`, `model` | Optional. Passed through when a review thread spawns. |
